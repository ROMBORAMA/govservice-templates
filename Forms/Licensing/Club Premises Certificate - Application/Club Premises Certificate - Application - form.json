employer,</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) self-employed e.g. contracts, invoices, or audited accounts with a bank,</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) studying e.g. letter from the school, college or university and evidence of sufficient funds; or</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) self-sufficient e.g. bank statements.</p>\n<p>Family

sickness insurance in the UK. This can include a private medical insurance policy, an EHIC card or an S1, S2 or S3 form.</p>\n<p><strong>Original documents must not be sent to licensing authorities. </strong>If the document copied is a passport, a copy of the following pages should be provided:</p>\n<p>(i) any page containing the holder&rsquo;s personal details including nationality;</p>\n<p>(ii) any page containing the holder&rsquo;s photograph;</p>\n<p>(iii) any page containing the holder&rsquo;s signature;</p>\n<p>(iv) any page containing the date of expiry; and</p>\n<p>(v) any page containing information indicating the holder has permission to enter or remain in the UK and is permitted to work.</p>\n<p>If the document is not a passport, a copy of the whole document should be provided.</p>\n<p>Your right to work will be checked as part of your licensing application and this could involve us checking your immigration status with the Home Office. We may otherwise share information with the Home Office. Your licence application will not be determined until you have complied with this guidance.</p>\n<p><strong>Home Office online right to work checking service </strong></p>\n<p>As an alternative to providing a copy of the documents listed above, applicants may demonstrate their right to work by allowing the licensing authority to carry out a check with the Home Office online right to work checking service.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate their right to work via the Home Office online right to work checking service, applicants should include in this application their 9-digit share code (provided to them upon accessing the service at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/prove-right-to-work\">https://www.gov.uk/prove-right-to-work</a>) which, along with the applicant&rsquo;s date of birth (provided within this application), will allow the licensing authority to carry out the check.</p>\n<p>In order to establish the applicant&rsquo;s right to work, the check will need to indicate that the applicant is allowed to work in the United Kingdom and is not subject to a condition preventing them from doing work relating to the carrying on of a licensable activity.</p>\n<p>An online check will not be possible in all circumstances because not all applicants will have an immigration status that can be checked online. The Home Office online right to work checking service sets out what information and/or documentation applicants will need in order to access the service. Applicants who are unable to obtain a share code from the service should submit copy documents as set out above.</p>\n</div>",
