# GovService templates

Hi GovService buddies! ðŸ‘‹

This repo contains the JSON file exports of online services developed on the GovService platform.

<p>&nbsp;</p>




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Usage

The JSON samples provided are **form JSON exports and not process exports.**

Where forms integrate with a payment connector, I have removed this section for the export so that you can configure your own.

In some instances where a PDF is required of the completed form, a printable integration JSON export is also included with the form JSON.


### Prerequisites

* You will need the relevant service designer permissions granted to access the `Service designer` to import any form JSON.
* You will need the relevant service designer permissions granted to access the `Integrations Manager` to import any printable integration JSON.
